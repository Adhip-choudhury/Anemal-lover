        <h2>Hi!</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Dogs are just natural comedians. They are clumsy, messy, playful balls of joy wrapped up in fur and wiggly butts. So, with that in mind, we’ve gone ahead and compiled a list of hilariously appropriate funny dog quotes to make you smile almost as much as your dog makes you smile.

            “Outside of a dog, a book is a man’s best friend. Inside of a dog it’s too dark to read.” – Groucho Marx
            “My fashion philosophy is, if you’re not covered in dog hair, your life is empty.” – Elayne Boosler
            “No one appreciates the very special genius of your conversation as the dog does.” – Christopher Morley
            “Dog is God spelled backward.” – Duane Chapman
            “Scratch a dog and you’ll find a permanent job.” – Franklin P. Jones
            “A boy can learn a lot from a dog: obedience, loyalty, and the importance of turning around three times before lying down.” – Robert Benchley
            “When a man’s best friend is his dog, that dog has a problem.” – Edward Abbey
            “Dogs have boundless enthusiasm but no sense of shame. I should have a dog as a life coach.” – Moby
            “You want a friend in Washington? Get a dog.” – Harry S Truman
            “The dog is the god of frolic.” – Henry Ward Beecher
            “Anybody who doesn’t know what soap tastes like never washed a dog.” – Franklin P. Jones
            “What do dogs do on their day off? Can’t lie around – that’s their job.” – George Carlin
            “I don’t understand people who don’t touch their pets. Their cat or dog is called a pet for a reason.” – Jarod Kintz
            “If you don’t own a dog, at least one, there is not necessarily anything wrong with you, but there may be something wrong with your life.” – Roger A. Caras
            “All his life he tried to be a good person. Many times, however, he failed. For after all, he was only human. He wasn’t a dog.” – Charles M Schulz
            “I like dogs. You always know what a dog is thinking. It has four moods. Happy, sad, cross, and concentrating. Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk.” – Mark Haddon
            “I’ve seen a look in dogs’ eyes, a quickly vanishing look of amazed contempt, and I am convinced that basically dogs think humans are nuts.” – John Steinbeck
            “They [dogs] never talk about themselves but listen to you while you talk about yourself, and keep up an appearance of being interested in the conversation.” – Jerome K. Jerome</p>
